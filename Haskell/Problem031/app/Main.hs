  -- Print, for debugging and verification that we're on the right track.  If 'amount' is 200, this takes FOREVER

  -- What's super, super interesting about this is that when I ran this with 'amount' = 200, my CPU utilization went to
  -- 500% (how is that possible on a 4-core Mac Mini?), which means, I think, that Haskell automatically parallelized
  -- the computation.  That's one of the huge beauties of pure functional programming: since functions don't have side
  -- effects, you can split the work up and run a bunch of them in parallel.  In the case of building a string from
  -- 73,000 entries, you can chunk up the work into building (# of cores) equal-sized (roughly) substrings and glue them
  -- together at the end.
